# Admin Dashboard Routing Structure

## Overview

The admin dashboard has been refactored from a single-page application with tabs to a proper multi-route structure. This ensures that each functionality has its own dedicated route, which solves the issue of page refreshes bouncing back to the home page.

## New Route Structure

### Admin Routes (Protected - Admin Only)

- `/admin/overview` - Dashboard Overview
- `/admin/staff` - Staff Management
- `/admin/add-employee` - Add New Employee
- `/admin/attendance` - Attendance Reports

### Authentication & Authorization

- All admin routes are protected and only accessible to logged-in users with admin role
- Non-admin users attempting to access admin routes are redirected to `/dashboard`
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`

## Components Created

### 1. AdminLayout (`/src/components/admin/AdminLayout.jsx`)

- Main layout component for admin dashboard
- Contains navigation menu and header
- Handles routing between different admin functionalities
- Provides consistent layout across all admin pages

### 2. AdminOverview (`/src/components/admin/AdminOverview.jsx`)

- Dashboard overview with key statistics
- Recent activity display
- Main landing page for admin users

### 3. StaffManagement (`/src/components/admin/StaffManagement.jsx`)

- Employee listing and management
- Search functionality
- Employee details modal
- Delete employee functionality
- Add employee modal (integrated)

### 4. AddEmployee (`/src/components/admin/AddEmployee.jsx`)

- Dedicated page for adding new employees
- Comprehensive form with all employee fields
- Form validation and error handling
- Success feedback

### 5. AttendanceReports (`/src/components/admin/AttendanceReports.jsx`)

- Attendance data visualization
- Date filtering functionality
- CSV export capability
- Detailed attendance records table

## Key Features

### Navigation Persistence

- Each route maintains its own state

- Direct URL access to specific admin functions
- Browser back/forward navigation works properly

### Protected Routes

- `ProtectedRoute` component updated to support admin-only routes
- Role-based access control implemented
- Automatic redirection based on user authentication and role

### Responsive Design

- All components maintain the modern, responsive design
- Consistent styling across all admin pages
- Mobile-friendly navigation and layouts

## Usage

### For Admins

1. Login with admin credentials

3. Use navigation menu to access different functionalities:
   - **Dashboard Overview**: View key metrics and recent activity
   - **Staff Management**: Manage existing employees
   - **Add Employee**: Add new employees to the system
   - **Attendance Reports**: View and export attendance data

### For Developers

- Each admin functionality is now a separate component
- Easy to maintain and extend individual features
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable components and consistent patterns

## Migration Benefits

4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Modular component structure
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new admin functionalities as separate routes
