      "presentToday": 1,
      "absentToday": 6,
      "attendancePercentage": 14,
      "presentEmployees": [...], // Array with login/logout times
      "absentEmployees": [...]   // Array of absent employees
    }
    // ... more roles
  ]
}
```

### 2. Frontend Enhancements

  - Present/absent counts
- ✅ **Expandable Details**: Click any role card to see:
  - **Present Employees**: Names, emails, login times, logout times
  - **Absent Employees**: Names, emails, absence status
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Modern cards with icons, color coding, and responsive design
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if API calls fail

**Updated API Service**: `frontend/src/services/api.js`

- Added `getDashboardStatsByRole()` method
